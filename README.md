# Menu Driven Linked List Operations

This repository contains a **C** program for a menu-driven linked list operations assignment developed for our DAA Lab class. The project—**VAT DAA LAB (A) QUESTION**—was a collaborative effort by me and my friend **Nuna**.

## Overview

The program provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic linked list operations such as:
- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**
- **Traversal**
- **Search**
- **Update**

Each operation is dynamically managed with efficient memory handling using standard C library functions.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Easily select the desired operation.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Uses `malloc` and `free` to manage memory effectively.
- **Robust Implementation**: Handles typical edge cases in linked list manipulation.
